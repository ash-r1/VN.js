# VN.js

PIXI.js (5.x) + TypeScript Based Visual Novel Game Engine

⚠️ It's still under development. You CANNOT use it on your product yet.

NOTE: I personally recommend similar concept well-developed VN engine SKYNovel. https://www.npmjs.com/package/@famibee/skynovel

## Features

(Just a dream.)

- Pluggable, easy to extend
- Safety, find inconsistency on compile-time with TypeScript (as much as possible)
- Programmer friendly, 
  - Get rid of DSL based macro definition, we prefer to use TypeScript to define specific logic.

## Status

In Progress.
